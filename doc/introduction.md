Introduction to ALDAPA
======================

## What is ALDAPA?

The aim of ALDAPA is to automate as much as possible the pipelines for creating RDF data from other sources: For example, it automatically adds useful metadata about the process of converting data to RDF. The idea is that a Java developer can define pipelines easily, avoiding tedious steps like metadata creation. 

The main motivation for ALDAPA is to help us produce RDF at [Eurohelp Consulting](http://www.eurohelp.es) in different projects, and therefore it reflects our needs, but we release it in the hope that it will be useful for others in similar situations. 

## Contributions

All contributions are welcome, including new issues, documentation, new plugins, new pipelines and improvements of ALDAPA core itself. Please note when sending pull requests that we stick to [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) and [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html): have a look at the [open issues](https://github.com/mikel-egana-aranguren/ALDAPA/issues).
