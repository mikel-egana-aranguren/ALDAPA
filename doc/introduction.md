Introduction to ALDAPA
======================

## What is ALDAPA?

The aim of ALDAPA is to automate as much as possible the pipelines for creating RDF data from other sources. For example, it automatically adds useful metadata about the process. 

The main motivation for ALDAPA is to help us produce RDF at Eurohelp.
