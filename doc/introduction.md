Introduction to ALDAPA
======================

## What is ALDAPA?

The aim of ALDAPA is to automate as much as possible the pipelines for creating RDF data from other sources: For example, it automatically adds useful metadata about the process of converting data to RDF. The idea is that a Java developer can define pipelines easily, avoiding tedious steps like metadata creation. 

The main motivation for ALDAPA is to help us produce RDF at [Eurohelp Consulting](http://www.eurohelp.es) in different projects, and therefore it reflects our needs, but we release it in the hope that it will be useful for others in similar situations. 

## Contributions

Contributions can be of two kinds: new plugins and improvements of ALDAPA itself. Both kinds are wellcome so send your Pull Requests! (We try to stick to GitFlow as much as possible).
